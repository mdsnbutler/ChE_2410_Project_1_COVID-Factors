# ChE_2410_Project_1_COVID-Factors
# Analyzing 2021 COVID cases by county, looking for a relationship to public transportation
# With or without a relationship to public transportation, was population density an interactive factor in these data? Put another way, is any relationship with public transportation usage just measuring for a measure of city-ness.
# Practicing data vizualization & large-datasets manipulation via pandas & python
# To-do: export final graphs to github & readme, start powerpoint of final presentation, write out justifications for usage of data, test data (randomly sample 5 different counties and see if data matches across databases), if time make t-test hover program (mouse position determines x and y position on graph, determines p value of being greater than the x and y positions), pull up data on allegheny county to make conclusion relate back to motivations from beginning, make graph of transportation/density vs infections to justify linear and non-linear regression
